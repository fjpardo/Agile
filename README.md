# Paragraphs
This artice is about Amazon Web Services annoucing AWS Global Station services, which is a network of a dozen ground station attenas and connected to the AWS global network. What does this mean? That AWS has annouced the ability for customers to download information from satellites in the planets orbit. Why would we need this? To further enhace download time, and to be able to still download files from the network even if there is an outage in the world. This allows for customers to send data from space to Earth. 

Customers will be able to use these services and pay for usage by the minute. Amazon is slowly sending more and more satellites for customers to use. 
  
>Yashodhan Singh's comment:  
>Amazon is really pushing the boundaries of network operations with this. Enhancing download time is extremely important in this day and age.
